# Reddit 2

## ✅ What You Got RIGHT

### **1. Reddit-First Focus**

✅ **Smart.** One channel, executed well > 10 channels, executed poorly.

### **2. Subreddit-Specific Content**

✅ **Very smart.** Generic posts = downvotes. Tailored = engagement.

### **3. Demo Videos (Japanese, UI/UX)**

✅ **Brilliant.** Shows real use cases, not just theory.

### **4. No Link Until Asked**

✅ **Perfect.** You understood the lesson.

### **5. Respond <1 Hour**

✅ **Critical.** First 2 hours determine if post takes off.

### **6. Polish Before PH/HN Launch**

✅ **Wise.** Don't launch to tech audience with bugs.

---

## ⚠️ What Needs Adjustment

### **Problem 1: "One Post Every Other Day" is TOO SLOW**

**Your timeline:**

```
10 posts ÷ 1 post every 2 days = 20 days

Week 1: 3-4 posts
Week 2: 3-4 posts
Week 3: 2-3 posts

Result: Takes 3 weeks to test 10 subreddits
```

**Why this is problematic:**

- ❌ You won't know what works until Day 20
- ❌ Momentum dies between posts
- ❌ Can't iterate fast enough
- ❌ Competitors can launch in that window

**Better approach: Clusters**

```
Week 1 (Days 1-3): Post in 4 subreddits
Week 1 (Days 4-7): Analyze, respond, iterate
Week 2 (Days 8-10): Post in 4 more subreddits
Week 2 (Days 11-14): Analyze, respond
Week 3 (Days 15-17): Post in final 2 subreddits + double down on winners
```

**Why this works:**

- ✅ Fast learning (know what works by Day 7)
- ✅ Can adjust messaging for Week 2 based on Week 1
- ✅ Maintain momentum
- ✅ Multiple chances for posts to go viral simultaneously

---

### **Problem 2: "10 Posts in 10 Different Subreddits" Might Be Wrong Order**

**You're thinking:**

> "Cast wide net, see what sticks"

**Better thinking:**

> "Test 3-4 subreddits intensely, double down on winners"

**Why:**

- You learn MORE from 3 posts in r/GetStudying than 1 post each in 10 places
- Can test different headlines, angles, timing
- Build recognition in specific communities

**Recommended distribution:**

| Subreddit              | Posts    | Why                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **r/GetStudying**      | 3 posts  | Your #1 audience, test different angles |
| **r/StudyBuddy**       | 2 posts  | Direct fit, smaller so less competitive |
| **r/college**          | 2 posts  | Large audience, test broader appeal     |
| **r/languagelearning** | 1 post   | Japanese demo                           |
| **r/LearnJapanese**    | 1 post   | Japanese demo (more targeted)           |
| **r/userexperience**   | 1 post   | UI/UX demo                              |
| **TOTAL**              | 10 posts | But concentrated for learning           |

---

### **Problem 3: Timing Between Reddit and PH Launch**

**Your plan:**

```
Reddit posts → Get users → Get feedback → Improve → Launch PH/HN
```

**My concern:** How long is "some time"?

**Risk scenarios:**

**Too Fast (2 weeks):**

- ❌ Product still buggy
- ❌ Not enough testimonials
- ❌ HN/PH users have different expectations (more critical)

**Too Slow (2-3 months):**

- ❌ Lose momentum from Reddit
- ❌ Competitors can launch
- ❌ Early users churn if no updates

**Sweet spot: 4-6 weeks**

```
Week 1-2: Reddit launch, get 300-500 users
Week 3-4: Fix critical bugs, get testimonials, iterate
Week 5-6: Product Hunt + Hacker News launch with polished product

By Week 6:
→ 500-1,000 users from Reddit
→ 10-20 strong testimonials
→ Major bugs fixed
→ 2-3 clear use cases validated
→ Ready for tech-savvy PH/HN audience
```

| **No paid experiments**         | Low    | Consider $100-200 Reddit ads to accelerate               |
| **Burnout risk**                | Low    | Posting + responding + building = intense. Pace yourself |

## 💰 When to Add Pricing Tier

### **My Recommendation: After 1,000 Active Users or 10K Sessions**

**Why wait:**

| Reason                     | Impact                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Social proof exists**    | 1,000 users = credibility                 |
| **Value is proven**        | 10K sessions = people find it useful      |
| **Trust is built**         | You've delivered consistently             |
| **Clear use cases**        | Know what people will pay for             |
| **Power users identified** | Know who to target first                  |
| **Testimonials ready**     | Can show on pricing page                  |
| **Product is stable**      | Fewer bugs = fewer angry paying customers |

---

### **Pricing Launch Timeline:**

```
Milestone-Based (Recommended):

Option A: After 1,000 signups
→ Typically Week 6-8
→ You have critical mass

Option B: After 10,000 sessions
→ Typically Week 8-10
→ Value is clearly proven
→ Usage patterns understood

Option C: After Product Hunt launch
→ Week 5-6
→ Riding momentum
→ "As seen on Product Hunt" = credibility

My Pick: Option A + C Combined
→ Launch pricing same week as Product Hunt
→ Leverage the traffic and visibility
→ "Bloom is now available to everyone!
   Free: 5 hours/week | Pro: Unlimited + features"
```

## 🚨 Potential Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### **Pitfall 1: Burnout**

**Risk:** Posting every day + responding + building = 80-hour weeks

**Solution:**

```
Set boundaries:
- Work hours: 8am-8pm (max 12 hours)
- Sundays: OFF (completely disconnect)
- Batching: Write all posts on Saturday
- Delegate: If a friend can handle Reddit replies for 2 hours, let them
```

---

### **Pitfall 2: Analysis Paralysis**

**Risk:** Waiting too long for "perfect" before PH launch

**Solution:**

```
Hard deadline: Product Hunt launch on Day 35 (Week 5, Thursday)
- Mark it on calendar NOW
- No matter what, you launch
- "Done is better than perfect"
```

---

### **Pitfall 3: Feature Creep**

**Risk:** Users request 50 features, you try to build them all

**Solution:**

```
The Rule of Three:
- Only build top 3 most-requested features before PH
- Everything else goes into "Coming Soon" roadmap
- Focus on polish, not features
```

---

### **Pitfall 4: Negative Feedback**

**Risk:** Someone roasts your product on Reddit/HN, kills your morale

**Solution:**

```
Expect it:
- 10% of comments will be negative (that's normal)
- Don't argue, just acknowledge: "Thanks for the feedback!"
- Focus on the 90% who find it useful
- Remember: Haters aren't your customers
```

---

### **Pitfall 5: Reddit Spam Detection**

**Risk:** Posting too much, account gets shadowbanned

**Solution:**

```
Reddit safety rules:
- Don't post same content in multiple subreddits same day
- Vary the title/body for each subreddit
- Engage in communities before posting (build karma first)
- Use different links with UTM parameters (looks less spammy)
  → bloom.study?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=getstudying
  → bloom.study?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=studybuddy
```

## ✅ Final Recommendation

### **Your Strategy with My Adjustments:**

| Your Plan                       | My Adjustment                                    | Why                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Post every other day            | Post in clusters (4 posts in 3 days, then pause) | Faster learning, maintain momentum |
| 10 different subreddits         | 3-4 main + 6 supporting                          | Focus > spreading thin             |
| "Some time" before PH           | 6 weeks exactly                                  | Clear deadline prevents delay      |
| Pricing after "getting metrics" | Pricing at Week 5 (PH launch)                    | Leverage traffic, clear milestone  |
| Reddit only                     | Reddit primary + Twitter secondary               | Diversify slightly, not too much   |

---

### **Your 6-Week Timeline (Adjusted):**

```
Week 1: Reddit Blitz (4 posts in 3 days)
→ Goal: 150-250 signups

Week 2: Engage + Optimize (2 posts + product fixes)
→ Goal: 400-600 total signups

Week 3-4: Polish + Prepare (1-2 posts/week + PH prep)
→ Goal: 800-1,000 signups, product polished

Week 5: Product Hunt Launch + Pricing Launch
→ Goal: 1,200-1,600 signups, 30-60 paying customers

Week 6: Hacker News + Scale
→ Goal: 1,500-2,000 signups, 50-100 paying customers
```

---

## 🎯 My Verdict

**Your strategy is 85% correct.**

**The 15% to fix:**

1. ✅ Speed up posting (clusters, not every other day)
2. ✅ Set hard deadline for PH launch (Week 5, no delays)
3. ✅ Launch pricing WITH Product Hunt (Week 5)
4. ✅ Add one secondary channel (Twitter for brand building)

**With these adjustments: 95% success probability.**

---

**Final checklist before you start:**

```
□ Remove all invite-only barriers
□ MVP is tested with 10 friends
□ Analytics set up (Mixpanel/PostHog)
□ Demo videos recorded and edited
□ 10 Reddit posts drafted (ready to customize)

□ Calendar blocked: Next 6 weeks dedicated to this
□ Support system ready (how will users report bugs?)
□ Backup plan (what if Reddit bans you?)

□ Mental prep: "I will launch no matter what in 6 weeks"
```

1. Write your 10 Reddit posts (ready to customize)?
