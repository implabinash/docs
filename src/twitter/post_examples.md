```
Thread: "I'm launching Rawph today to my first 10 users.

Here's what I'm terrified about:
1. What if the sync breaks during their first session?
2. What if no one shows up?
3. What if they hate the UI?

Following up with how it goes tomorrow.

If you want to try it with a friend: [link]"
```

**Why this works:**

- Vulnerability (people root for vulnerable)
- Stakes (launch creates tension)
- CTA (clear invitation)

---

#### **Tuesday:**

```
"Update: 8 people signed up yesterday.

3 actually created sessions.
1 session worked perfectly.
2 had audio issues (fixing tonight).

Most surprising: People want PDF support before more video features.

Didn't see that coming.

Talking to all 8 today to understand what they actually need."
```

**Why this works:**

- Real numbers (8 people, 3 sessions)
- Honest about problems (2 had audio issues)
- Surprise insight (PDFs)
- Action plan (talking to users)

---

#### **Wednesday:**

```
"Just watched Sarah and Mike use Rawph.

Mike: 'Wait, we're in sync? I thought we'd have lag.'
Sarah: 'This whiteboard is way better than Zoom's'

Then the video froze. 🤦

The look on their faces...

Back to debugging. But seeing someone use what you built hits different."
```

**Why this works:**

- User quotes (social proof)
- Behind-the-scenes (watching users)
- Vulnerability (it broke)
- Emotion (hits different)

---

#### **Thursday:**

```
"Fixed the freeze bug.

Turns out I was calling the YouTube API every 100ms.
(No wonder it crashed)

Changed to 500ms. Smooth as butter now.

Mike and Sarah tried again. Perfect sync.

Sometimes the solution is simpler than you think.

10 users, 15 sessions so far. More coming."
```

**Why this works:**

- Technical but accessible
- Problem → solution
- Confirmation (Mike and Sarah validated)
- Progress (10 users, 15 sessions)

---

#### **Friday:**

```
"Week 1 of Rawph: Done

Numbers:
• 12 signups
• 8 active users
• 18 study sessions
• 2 major bugs fixed
• 1 surprise feature request (PDFs)

Top lesson: Watching users > building features

Next week: Getting to 50 users

Thanks to everyone who tried it 🙏"
```

**Why this works:**

- Scorecard (clear metrics)
- Lessons (watching users)
- Forward-looking (50 users goal)
- Gratitude (humanizing)

---

#### **Monday:**

```
"This week's goal: 50 users

Strategy:
• Post on r/GetStudying (300K members)
• r/StudyBuddy (50K members)
• Personal outreach (DM 20 students)

Never done Reddit marketing before.
Watched 3 YouTube videos on "how to not get banned"

Posting tomorrow 8am. Wish me luck 😅"
```

**Why this works:**

- Clear goal (50 users)
- Transparent strategy
- Vulnerability (never done this)
- Stakes (might get banned)

"Posted on Reddit 2 hours ago.

Result so far:
• 47 upvotes
• 12 comments
• 8 signups

Top comment: 'This is exactly what I needed!'
Another: 'Why isn't this built into Zoom?'

Responding to every comment.
This is nerve-wracking and exciting at the same time.

```

**Why this works:**

- Real-time update
- Actual numbers
- User validation (comments)
- Emotion (nerve-wracking)
- Visual proof (screenshot)

"Reddit update:

Post hit #2 on r/GetStudying
130 upvotes, 45 comments, 28 signups

But here's the thing nobody tells you:

Half the comments are about bugs I need to fix.
'Audio doesn't work on Firefox'
'Whiteboard lags on my phone'

Building in public means bugs in public.

Embarrassing? Yes.
Valuable? Hell yes.

Fixing Firefox audio tonight."
```

**Why this works:**

- Success (130 upvotes)
- Reality check (bugs)
- Vulnerability (embarrassing)
- Action (fixing tonight)

"3 AM.

Still debugging Firefox audio.

WebRTC peer connections hate Firefox apparently.

Found a workaround on StackOverflow from 2019.
Implementing now.

If you're building a startup:
• 80% is unglamorous debugging
• 15% is talking to users
• 5% is the "I'm changing the world" moments

Currently in the 80%."
```

**Why this works:**

- Real founder life (3 AM debugging)
- Specific technical detail (WebRTC)
- Perspective (80/15/5 breakdown)
- Relatable (unglamorous truth)

---

#### **Friday:**

```
"Week 2: Done

• 52 users (hit goal!)
• 180 sessions
• Reddit post: 200+ upvotes
• Firefox audio: FIXED
• New bug discovered: Safari whiteboard lag

Learning: Reddit > Twitter for early users (for now)

Next week: Product Hunt launch
Preparing demo video this weekend

Onwards 🚀"
```

**Why this works:**

- Goal achieved (52 users)
- Honest progress
- New challenge (Safari)
- Insight (Reddit > Twitter)
- Forward momentum (PH next)

**Monday:**

```
"Preparing for Product Hunt launch.

Things I'm doing:
• Making a 90-second demo video
• Writing the perfect tagline
• Collecting testimonials from users
• Fixing ALL the bugs

Things I'm worried about:
• Launching on wrong day (Fri-Sun are bad apparently)
• Getting roasted for bugs
• No one upvoting

Launching Week 5. Thursday. 12:01 AM PST.

Ready or not."
```

**Wednesday:**

```
"Made my first demo video for PH launch.

Watched 10 Product Hunt launches.
Analyzed top products.
Noticed pattern:

Good videos:
• Under 2 minutes
• Show, don't tell
• Real voiceover (not AI)
• Solve ONE problem

My video:
• 90 seconds
• Shows two students using Rawph
• My voice (slightly awkward but real)
• Solves: 'How do friends study together remotely?'

Thoughts? Should I show it early or save for launch?"
```

---

**Friday (Week 3):**

```
"Week 3 Status:

Users: 125
Sessions: 450
Bugs fixed: 12
Demo video: Done
Testimonials: 8
Sleep: Not enough

2 weeks until PH launch.

Making a rule: No new features until after launch.
Only: bug fixes + polish + talking to users

Focus > Feature creep"
```

#### **Thursday 12:01 AM PST:**

```
"We're live on Product Hunt! 🎉

Rawph: Study with friends remotely
↳ Synced video, voice, whiteboard
↳ Built for students who hate studying alone

125 students already learning together.
Today, I'm hoping for 1,000 more.

Check it out (and upvote if you like it):

Thank you all for following this journey.
This is terrifying and exciting at once.

Let's go 🚀"

Top comment: 'Why didn't this exist when I was in college?'

Still responding to every comment.
Someone asked about mobile app. Added to roadmap.

This is wild. Thank you everyone ❤️"

"End of Product Hunt day:

Final ranking: #4 Product of the Day 🎉
245 upvotes
78 comments
156 new signups

Lessons from today:
1. Respond to EVERY comment (<10 min)
2. Have answers ready for common questions
3. Your users will support you (shoutout to all who upvoted)
4. It's exhausting but worth it

280 users total now.
Celebrated with instant noodles at midnight.

Tomorrow: Hacker News?"
```

---

#### **Monday (Week 6):**

```
"Launched on Hacker News today.

Different vibe from Product Hunt:
• PH: 'This is cool!'
• HN: 'Here's why your architecture is wrong'

Getting roasted for my WebSocket implementation.
But also getting great technical feedback.

Currently #8 on front page.
85 new signups.

Note to self: HN is for developers, not students.
Adjust messaging accordingly."

"Hit 500 users yesterday 🎉

Milestone I'm proud of:
• 500 users in 6 weeks
• 2,500 study sessions
• 40% come back weekly

Milestone I'm scared of:
• Server costs up 3x
• 87 support emails this week
• Still solo (need help?)

The startup rollercoaster is real.

Question: Should I hire a part-time dev or keep solo longer?"
```

#### **Friday (Week 7):**

```
"Week 7 reflection:

I've been so focused on growth numbers, I forgot to talk to users.

This week I scheduled calls with 10 random users.

What I learned:
• They don't care about most features I'm building
• They want one thing: stability (no lag, no crashes)
• 7/10 would pay $5-10/month for unlimited sessions

Lesson: Talk. To. Users.

Pausing feature roadmap.
Focusing on stability for 2 weeks.
Then launching paid tier."
```

---

#### **Monday (Week 8):**

```
"Introducing Rawph Pro: $9/month

Free tier: 5 hours/week
Pro: Unlimited

Why now?
• 600+ users (validation)
• Server costs hurting (need revenue)
• Power users hitting limits

Launch offer: First 100 get 50% off forever ($4.50/mo)

Nervous about this.
What if no one pays?

We'll find out.
