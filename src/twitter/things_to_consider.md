# Things To Consider

```
DO:

✅ Lead with users, not features
✅ Show vulnerability (it broke, I'm scared, etc.)
✅ Share actual numbers (even if small)
✅ Tell stories (narrative beats facts)
✅ Be specific (names, quotes, situations)

DON'T:

❌ Lead with market size ($340B...)
❌ Announce features no one asked for
❌ Post status updates without stories
❌ Use corporate language
❌ Hide struggles
```

### The USUT Method

- U - User Stories (40% of content)
- S - Struggles & Learnings (30% of content)
- U - Updates & Milestones (20% of content)
- T - Thoughts & Insights (10% of content)

### Questions to Ask

- Does this reads like a pitch deck, not a tweet?
- Wait, what is Rawph? Why should I care?
- No personality?
- If added emoji, Why that emoji?
- why should I care about?
- Is this just a status update, not story?
- Where's the insight? The struggle? The learning?

### Profile's Must Haves

- Who are you? (personality, background, why you?)
- Who's using this? (user stories, testimonials)
- Why should I care? (what's in it for me as a reader?)
- What's working? (traction, growth, validation)

### Shift:

```
Current Focus: Features, API docs, commits
New Focus: Users, insights, traction

Current Voice: Product updates, technical deep dives
New Voice: Stories, struggles, surprises

Current Proof: "I built this feature"
New Proof: "Sarah used this and said..."
```
