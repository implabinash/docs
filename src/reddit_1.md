| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Too slow ("every other day")** | Takes 20 days to test 10 subreddits | **Cluster posts:** 4 in Week 1, 4 in Week 2 |
| **No backup channel**            | If Reddit bans you, you're stuck    | Add Twitter (low effort, build brand)       |
| **Vague PH timing**              | "After some time" = procrastination | **Hard deadline: Week 5 Thursday**          |
| **Pricing timing unclear**       | Waiting too long = lost revenue     | **Launch pricing Week 5 with PH**           |
| **Demo dependency**              | What if friends bail?               | Have backup: generic demo ready             |

## 📝 Ready-to-Use Reddit Post Templates

### **Post #1: r/GetStudying**

```
Title: "I've been trying to study with friends over Zoom and it's
frustrating. Here's what I built to fix it."

Body:
"For the past few months, I've been trying to learn React with a
friend remotely. We'd get on Zoom, one of us would share screen
with a YouTube tutorial, and it was always a mess:

• Videos constantly out of sync ("wait, what minute are you at?")
• Only one person could control the video
• We'd have to switch apps for whiteboarding

So I built a simple tool that syncs video playback between two
people, with voice chat and a shared whiteboard built in.

Not trying to sell anything—genuinely curious if other people have
this problem or if I'm just weird? 😅

[Optional: Here's what it looks like: [screenshot/GIF]]"
```

---

### **Post #2: r/StudyBuddy**

```
Title: "Made a simple tool for remote study sessions - looking for
feedback from people who actually study with partners"

Body:
"Hey r/StudyBuddy,

I lurk here a lot and see posts about finding study partners, but
haven't seen much about TOOLS for studying together remotely.

I built something specifically for this:
• Watch YouTube videos together (both people can control it, stays in sync)
• Voice chat built in
• Shared whiteboard for working through problems

It's super bare-bones right now, but it solves the problem I had
with my study partner (we were trying to use Zoom and it was clunky).

Would love feedback from people who actually use study partners:
1. What tools do you currently use?
2. What's most frustrating about studying remotely?
3. What features would make this actually useful?

Happy to let people try it out if you want to test with your study
buddy. Just DM me.

Not trying to promote, genuinely want to make this better based on
real user needs."
```

### **Post #3: r/college**

```
Title: "Junior in CS here - built a tool to study with my friend
across the country. Thought other students might find it useful."

Body:
"My best friend from freshman year transferred to another school
(we're both CS majors). We tried to keep studying together remotely
but Zoom made it so awkward - one person shares screen, other just
watches, constantly falling out of sync.

Got frustrated enough that I spent winter break building something
better. It's basically:
• YouTube video that both people control (stays perfectly in sync)
• Voice chat so you can actually discuss
• Whiteboard for working through problems together

We've been using it all semester and it's way better than Zoom for
study sessions. Not sure if other students have this problem, but
figured I'd share in case it's useful.

Anyone else try to study with friends at different schools? How do
you make it work?"
```
